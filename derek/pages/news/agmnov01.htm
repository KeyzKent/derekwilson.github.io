<p align="justify"><b>Liz&#146;s Birthday</b>. Meal out at Pacific on 30<sup>th</sup> 
November 2001. Presently Liz, Andrew, Sarah, and Derek are going.<br>
<font color="#004080">Hugh is unfortunately NOT able to attend - and he said that
during the meeting. It is, however, likely that Siobhan will be attending.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ians Birthday</b>. Ian looking into what night is best, 
either 15<sup>th</sup> or 16<sup>th</sup> December. Event and location not 
confirmed as yet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Xmas Meal</b>. At Derek and Stephs house January 
13<sup>th</sup> noon onwards. £10 per head can be paid on the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any food you would really like just let 
Steph or Derek know.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Oasis</b>. A discussion took place to the advantages of 
Oasis or Centre Parcs and Oasis won.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>We have lots of money so decided to get rid of the winter blues and book 
it soon. Dates will be 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 
11<sup>th</sup> of March 2002. If these dates are not good for the people who 
could not be at the meeting then Andrew is organising the event and needs to 
know soon as Oasis gets booked up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Andrew is looking into as separate house for Sue and Ian so they can 
bring the children. Louise said she was happy to share that house.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Falmouth</b>. Steph will look into the cost of a house for 
a week from1st June 2002. to 9<sup>th</sup> June 2002. These dates were 
initially discussed, as the Monday and Tuesday are Bank Holidays because the 
Queen is having her Golden Jubilee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Please let Steph know as soon as possible if these dates are OK, 
especially Alistair. A week&#146;s cost is being looked at as well as a weekend due 
to the travel distance. Costs would be on a per night basis.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ideas for an autumn event</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was decided not to book that far in advance but to think 
about what we would like to do. Suggestions included</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cottage in Yorkshire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Flights are currently cheep for weekend breaks abroad.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Barge.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Walking tour.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Crispie.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We discussed that it had been agreed that we were not booking 
events for a week but this could be considered at each discussion.
