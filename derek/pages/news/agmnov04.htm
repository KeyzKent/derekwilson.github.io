				<p align="justify">Ian wanted to question the rule that we need 75% agreement

				<p align="justify">Room booking for events. When people agree they are coming the 
					person booking the event should book an accommodation that is enables single 
					people to have their own room, if they desire. If the only accommodation 
					available will not enable this it should be discussed with anyone who would be 
					affected. If we then have a change in the number attending then members affected 
					by new people coming should be consulted before we agree to the new person 
					coming.</p>
				<p align="justify">Accommodation should be booked for 3 nights at weekends. If there 
					are 2 houses, unless we are 100% certain we do not need the second 
					accommodation for the 3rd night we still book it.</p>

					roles. Sarah asked that she could jointly book an event with somebody else..</p>
