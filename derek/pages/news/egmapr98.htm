Notes from Steph</strong></font></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="3">Subsequently to the meeting John
has agreed to allow BOBS to go to his house for the next BOBS event for August Bank
holiday for the Edinburgh festival (cost �500.00). 28<sup>st</sup>to 31st August. He is
sending down the details of events on. We will need to take food airbeds and bedding.
There are some spares up there. We have set a maximum of 12 places so we need to know who
definitely cannot go. Steph will organise the food. Mark is also happy to be paid back
part of his money for Oasis as suggested. </p>
