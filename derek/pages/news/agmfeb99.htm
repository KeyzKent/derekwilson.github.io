<p>The treasurers report was circulated (see attached)</p>
<p>If those members who had verbally said they were going 
had attended the Ledbury trip (in October 1998) then BOBS would not be bankrupt. 
However, repayments to non-attendees must be added onto the total charge, 
thereby increasing the cost by an unbudgeted 50%.</p>
<p>Two options were presented to allow for the 
repayments:</p> 
</font></font>
<ol><font size="5"><font face="Garamond" size="3">
    <li>Repay on what money was in the account.
    <li>Repay to the full value. 
</font></font></li></ol><font size="5"><font face="Garamond" size="3">
<p>In order to keep BOBS in credit it was voted by all 
members to repay according to what money was available - option 1) above.</p>
<p>In addition, non-BOBS members would be asked to 
contribute &amp;oelig;60 towards the cost of the trip.</p>
<p>Repayments are therefore to be as follows:</p>
<p>
<table border="1" cellPadding="1" cellSpacing="1" width="75%">
    
    <tr>
        <td>�0</td>
        <td>ER, HE</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>�35</td>
        <td>SW, CL, IL, SL, AD</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>�70</td>
        <td>SS, TM, PG, RG</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>�60</td>
        <td>MB</td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>�515</td>
        <td>Total to be repaid</td></tr></table></p>
<p>Incomings:</p>
<p>
<table border="1" cellPadding="1" cellSpacing="1" width="75%">
    
    <tr>
        <td>�60</td>
        <td>SB</td></tr></table></p>
<p>In this way it would keep the BOBS account in credit. 
Note that the handling of the accounts in this manner does not set a precedent 
for any future BOBS events. </p>
<p>Future Policy for future BOBS events was discussed. Were 
the BOBS events meeting the needs of the members ? </p>
<p>The opinion was that they were if chosen carefully and 
kept to two a year. However, new rules should be introduced to ensure that the 
events continued to meet those needs. The following were proposed for universal 
BOBS approval. </p>
<p>Future events </p>

<ol><font size="5"><font face="Garamond" size="3">
    <li>If you say you will not be going and do not go, then you will be 
    entitled to a full refund.</li>

    members who have committed to going will have priority over 
    accommodation.</li>
    <li>If you say you will go (at time of booking) and do not go then you will 
    not be entitled to a refund.</li>
    <li>If you say you will go even for part days of the total time booked, you 
    will receive a refund on the remaining time that you will be not there. If, 
    however, you decide to stay on for longer then originally booked then 
    additional days will be negotiated at each event.</li>
    <li>Non BOBS members will continue to be invited on an informal consensus 
    and charged at the appropriate cost for the event.</li>
