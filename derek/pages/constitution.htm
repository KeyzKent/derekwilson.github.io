<h1><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#004080">BOBS Constitution and Rules</font></h1>

<p>This constitution is based on the one hand-copied into Steph's diary. I have
transcribed it and amended it slightly (turning it into English as I go). Suggestions by
other BOBS members have also been incorporated. I would suggest at the next BOBS meeting
we vote on this new constitution. Steph will bring along her paper copy for comparison.
Please note that the constitution does not detail how to change the constitution so I
would encourage all members to attend the next meeting so their voice is heard. After it
has been voted on it will not be amended, except at meetings, I would suggest a paper copy
be available at all future meetings.</p>

        depending on the passed on cost to other members.<br>
    </ul>
