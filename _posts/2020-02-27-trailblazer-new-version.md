This month we have released a new version of [Trailblazer][trailblazer-play].

Trailblazer is a simple, quick and easy to use track recorder, for hiking, running cycling etc. You can record and share your tracks. The app was inspired by MyTracks - a Google app that is now deprecated. The app is supported on all Android phones from Android 4 up.

I have been a bit preoccupied with travelling and other projects. However I have managed to get back to doing some work on Trailblazer. The new version has much better map zoom handling and an additional graph in the statistics page.
