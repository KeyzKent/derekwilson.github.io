<p>This year I&rsquo;ve been working on my first <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2013/02/24/TextByNumbers.aspx" target="_blank">real project using HTML5</a> and I think its gone pretty well. I&rsquo;ve even used PhoneGap to <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2013/06/27/Keeping-common-source-between-Phonegap-and-HTML5-apps.aspx" target="_blank">use the assets in an Android application</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>I thought I would take the final step and publish the app on Google Play. I have to say its a pretty painless process (though its not free) and its well documented on the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/?hl=en" target="_blank">Google developers site</a> as well as <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android/publish-to-android-market/" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.textbynumbers&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">The application is now available</a>, and the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/textbynumbers/overview" target="_blank">source code</a> is public as well.</p>
<p>It was written to solve a particular problem an particular person was having, I guess I&rsquo;d like to revisit it in future and make it more generally useful by adding in application editing of snippets.</p>
