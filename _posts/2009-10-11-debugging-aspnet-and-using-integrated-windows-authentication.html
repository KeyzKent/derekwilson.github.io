<p><a href="/2009/09/26/using-integrated-windows-authentication-in-iis.html">Last post</a> I was looking at using integrated windows authentication in IIS. When I am working on a web site like this on my dev machine I often turn integrated windows authentication off and Basic Authentication on. This enables me to access the web site using different credentials that I can just type into the browser.</p><!--more-->

<p>Please note that I only do this on my dev machine and would not recommend doing this in any public / production environment.</p>
<p>However there can be problems with the Visual Studio debugger. I noticed that sometimes I would try to set breakpoints but they would not be hit in the debugger. When I set breakpoints there was obviously something wrong as they appeared like this</p>
<p><a href="/images/wordpress/Deb.NETandusingIntegratedWindowsAuthenti_91B4/breakpoint2.png"><img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="breakpoint2" src="/images/wordpress/Deb.NETandusingIntegratedWindowsAuthenti_91B4/breakpoint2_thumb.png" alt="breakpoint2" width="340" height="185" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And if I hovered over the yellow triangle with the mouse pointer then the tooltip appeared showing &ldquo;The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document&rdquo; like this</p>
<p><a href="/images/wordpress/Deb.NETandusingIntegratedWindowsAuthenti_91B4/breakpoint3.png"><img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="breakpoint3" src="/images/wordpress/Deb.NETandusingIntegratedWindowsAuthenti_91B4/breakpoint3_thumb.png" alt="breakpoint3" width="347" height="138" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This puzzled me, the symbols should be available, I check all the obvious stuff like was I trying to debug a release build (yes I have done that in the past and its very frustrating) but there was nothing obviously wrong. I checked out the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jimgries/pages/visual-studio-debugger-faq.aspx">VS debugger FAQ</a> but none of the reasons it gave seemed to apply.</p>
<p>I did eventually find out what the problem was by spotting the pattern in what I was changing. The triangle appeared when I turned anonymous access off on the web site and forced authentication. If I checked integrated windows authentication then the breakpoints appeared normally and worked</p>

<p>I *think* what is happening is that VS debugger cannot authenticate against the w3wp worker process, I can use basic authentication in a browser, as it gives me a dialog to enter my credentials however VS does not ask for credentials. I can even attach the browser using basic authentication credentials and then turn on integrated windows authentication and then attach the debugger and it will work.</p>
