<p>We have just completed a new version of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/podcastutilities/wiki/Home">PodcastUtilities</a>, it now supports a post download command. Using this command its easy to hook up utilities such as <a href="http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/">MP3Gain</a> or any other post processing command. This build also contains some bug fixes including support for running the utilities from UNC paths.</p>  <p>There is a ready-to-go compiled Windows version available to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/podcastutilities/downloads">download</a>, which includes the utilities and documentation.</p>  <p>We are planning to take a bit of break from working on the utilities but we will still continue to maintain the code and fix bugs.</p>
