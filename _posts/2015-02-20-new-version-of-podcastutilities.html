<p>This month I have done a maintenance release of PodcastUtilities. Iâ€™ve added the option to delete any old empty folders that occur during download or synchronisation.</p>  <p>The new version (2.1.0.6) is now in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/podcastutilities/wiki/Home">BitBucket</a> and also available as a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/podcastutilities/downloads">binary download</a> if you just want to run PodcastUtilities. </p>
