<p>At Christmas I bought myself a <a href="https://www.pebble.com/pebble-time-smartwatch-features">Pebble Time</a>. I often buy myself a Christmas present as its a great way of getting exactly what you want. Actually I didn't know if I wanted a Pebble but six months in I think its a great device, a smart watch that only needs charging once a week but works great in bright sunshine is a real triumph, I rally didn't want a smartwatch the conks out at 9pm. </p><!--more-->  <p>The Pebble is still evolving and its still getting better. One of things that wasn't there when I bough it was activity tracking - there was no build in app. So I started trying all the available options to see which I liked. As an consequence of doing this I got to compare all the readings from each one on exactly the same hardware, I tend to walk pretty much the same each week day and sleep the same each week.</p>  <p>Here are the results from the step counters</p>  <p>   <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="455" border="0"><tbody>       <tr>         <td valign="top" width="94">Steps</td>          <td valign="top" width="50"><a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/54e23ff0cf66dc457400001e?dev_settings=true&amp;query=plexfit&amp;section=watchapps">PlexFit</a></td>          <td valign="top" width="50"><a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5429c7b7dfdebeb8dd000021?dev_settings=true&amp;query=up&amp;section=watchfaces">Up</a></td>          <td valign="top" width="69"><a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/53a898a2cfee2a02c900006c?dev_settings=true&amp;query=misfit&amp;section=watchapps">Misfit</a></td>          <td valign="top" width="83"><a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/52b1ed8bc7543f7509000025?dev_settings=true&amp;query=letsmuv&amp;section=watchapps">LetsMuv</a></td>          <td valign="top" width="110"><a href="https://help.getpebble.com/customer/portal/articles/2239065-pebble-health?b_id=8308">Pebble Health</a></td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top" width="94">Ave per Day</td>          <td valign="top" width="50">           <p align="right">10,497</p>         </td>          <td valign="top" width="50">           <p align="right">12,112</p>         </td>          <td valign="top" width="73">           <p align="right">13,048</p>         </td>          <td valign="top" width="83">           <p align="right">15,887</p>         </td>          <td valign="top" width="110">           <p align="right">13,928</p>         </td>       </tr>     </tbody></table> </p>  <p>I did look at the individual days data from each tracker and I found that each tracker recorded a similar number of steps each day however the trackers diverge markedly from each other. Iâ€™d guess that they are not particularly accurate but can be used to compare one days activity with another, as long as you use the same tracker.</p>  <p>Of the apps, I disliked PlexFit as it lost data if the bluetooth was switched off (which I do over night as it extends the battery life by a day). I also disliked Up as it replaced my watch face and I am rather draw to <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55a5c024f4510f794c000071?dev_settings=true&amp;query=timestyle&amp;section=watchfaces">TimeStyle</a>. MisFit and LetsMuv are both pretty good, however sometimes Misfit can struggle to sync with your phone and LetsMuv is a little basic if you dont pay for it. After I had done all this research Pebble released their own app and I have to say its the one I use. It works very well and does not occupy that valuable background app slot.</p>  <p>I also tracked my sleep pattern, the times here are in decimal hours, not hours and minutes.</p>  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="510" border="0"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="121">Sleep</td>        <td valign="top" width="55">Up</td>        <td valign="top" width="62">MisFit</td>        <td valign="top" width="75">LetsMuv</td>        <td valign="top" width="74"><a href="http://www.morpheuz.net">Morpheuz</a></td>        <td valign="top" width="121">Pebble Health</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="121">Ave Hours</td>        <td valign="top" width="55">         <p align="right">6.33</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="62">         <p align="right">7.07</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="75">         <p align="right">6.47</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="74">         <p align="right">6.74</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="121">         <p align="right">5.71</p>       </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="121">Deep sleep hours</td>        <td valign="top" width="55">         <p align="right"></p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="62">         <p align="right">2.43</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="75">         <p align="right">2.21</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="74">         <p align="right">1.45</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="121">         <p align="right">1.76</p>       </td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>The addition here is Morpheuz, which is great but doesn't do enough to justify installing it after I have pebble health.</p>  <p>Now as it happens shortly after recording there measurements I managed to come off my bike and hurt myself quite a lot. I broke many ribs, punctured a lung and broke my clavicle to the extent that I needed to have it pinned. Suffice it to say I have been in quite a lot of pain for the last couple of months.</p>  <p>Like I said above I am not convinced that we can really compare between the apps but comparing my sleep patter over time using the same app should be interesting.</p>  <p>This is the data for my sleep pattern from before the accident and the week after the accident.</p>  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400" border="0"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="133">Sleep</td>        <td valign="top" width="133">         <p align="right">Before</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="133">         <p align="right">After</p>       </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="133">Ave Hours</td>        <td valign="top" width="133">         <p align="right">5.71</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="133">         <p align="right">7.19</p>       </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="133">Deep sleep Hours</td>        <td valign="top" width="133">         <p align="right">1.76</p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="133">         <p align="right">1.28</p>       </td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>The results seem to make sense. I am sleeping almost one and a half hours a night longer, however my sleep is more disturbed. In incidentally I have also lost nearly 4 Kg weight despite not doing any exercise, I have to say I am slightly surprised that the accident has had such a large impact on my life and my body.&#160; </p>
