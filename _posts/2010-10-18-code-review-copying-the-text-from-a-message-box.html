<p>Strictly speaking this snippet isn&rsquo;t even code however it did come up in a code review and I&rsquo;ve made use of it often. Lots of times when an error message appears I need to be able to get the text from an error message dialog, either I want to find the text in source code or to use it to search the internet.</p><!--more-->
<p>It turns out that as long as the developer has used the standard Message Box, either using Windows unmanaged API or the .NET managed MessageBox wrappers then you can use CTRL C while the message box has focus and the text from the dialog will be placed on the clipboard.</p>
<p>Taking a completely random example of starting up Google Earth without an internet connection available the following message is displayed</p>
<p><a href="/images/wordpress/CodeReviewCopyingthetextfromaMessageBox_12FB8/image.png"><img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="image" src="/images/wordpress/CodeReviewCopyingthetextfromaMessageBox_12FB8/image_thumb.png" alt="image" width="415" height="144" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In the past I have retyped phrases from the message and looked for them but this is obviously quite error prone. However by using CTRL C the following text is placed on the clipboard.</p>

Warning
---------------------------
&lt;html&gt;Google Earth could not contact the authentication server to activate
your session.The application will continue to operate but will only display
data available locally (in cache).&lt;p&gt;For information about how to resolve
the problem, would you like to run a diagnostic test? This test attempts
to detect settings on your computer that might prevent Google Earth from
functioning properly.&lt;/html&gt;

&amp;Yes   &amp;No

<p>Enjoy.</p>
