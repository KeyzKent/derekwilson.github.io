<p>I have been working on a new native Android application. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.recommender">Recommender</a> is an application to store, organize and share personal recommendations: music, films, books, apps, web sites, restaurants â€“ pretty much anything.</p>  <p>Its designed to be used in person where you want to pass on a recommendation to a friend. There is no web service, there is no need to register you details anywhere. This is not an anonymous crowd sourced opinion its intended for low volume but high value recommendations.</p>  <p>All data is stored on your device, it can be shared or backed up into a common textual interchange format (JSON).</p>  <p>You can share recommendations with anyone via email. Though it is a more straightforward process if the other person also has Recommender installed.</p>  <p><a href="/images/2015-10-06%2005.37.40.png"><img title="2015-10-06 05.37.40" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="2015-10-06 05.37.40" src="/images/2015-10-06%2005.37.40_thumb.png" width="163" height="269" /></a> </p>  <p>The <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/recommender-android">source code</a> is also publically available. It uses Dagger2 IoC, an MVP pattern and make extensive use of Junit tests to verify the business logic.</p>
