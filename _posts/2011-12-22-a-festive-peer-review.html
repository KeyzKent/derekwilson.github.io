<p>Its the festive season and I bake a Christmas cake most years. I bake it in August and then let it mature until December. I was given a Christmas cook book years ago and have used the recipe out of that book ever since.</p>
<p>Last year I decided to seek a peer review of the cake and who would be better to do that than mum. She said it was very nice but I had used so much fruit that the cake tended to fall apart, now that she mentioned it all my Christmas cakes have fallen apart. She said I needed to use more flour in the mix as this would get the cake to bind.</p>
<p>And she was right, this years cake is much better.</p>

<p>It just goes to show that no matter how good I think I am doing having another set of eyes can make the results even better.</p>
