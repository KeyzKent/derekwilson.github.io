<p>Last year I wrote <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.measureme">MeasureMe</a> a native Android application. I have just started a new project I find it interesting the difference in tools and techniques I am using only 18 months after MeasureMe.</p>
<p>At the time I identified four main areas that I addressed first.</p>
<ol>
<li>Logging</li>
<li>Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Automated Building</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2014 I used <a href="/blog/2014/08/04/build-configurations-in-native-android-apps-using-ant.aspx">eclipse and ant to control the build process</a>, <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2014/07/25/logging-in-native-android-apps.aspx">logging was handled by slf4j and logback</a>, for <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2014/05/01/ioc-in-native-android-apps.aspx">dependency injection i used roboguice</a> and <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2014/09/19/unit-testing-in-native-android-apps.html">UnitTesting was done on pure java classes using JUnit.</a></p>
<p>In 2015 I have made some changes. I now use <a href="/blog/2015/01/24/migrating-from-eclipse-to-androidstudio.html">AndroidStudio and Gradle to build the application</a>. I still use JUnit to write unit tests however <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/triumph-android-studio-1-2-sneaks-in-full-testing-support/">Google has made life much easier</a> and there is now a <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/unit-testing-support">mock android layer available</a>. I also use <a href="http://robolectric.org">RoboElectric</a> to extend the reach of the tests. Logging has remains the same and I am very happy with <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">slf4j</a> and <a href="http://tony19.github.io/logback-android/">logback</a>.</p>
<p>I have moved to <a href="http://google.github.io/dagger/">Dagger2</a> for dependency injection. Last year I used <a href="https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/wiki">RoboGuice</a> and at the time it was a <a href="/blog/2014/05/01/ioc-in-native-android-apps.html">close call</a> between it and <a href="http://square.github.io/dagger/">Dagger1</a>. In the end I chose RoboGuice largely because the syntax was more familiar and there appeared to be more support and examples for it.</p>
<p>One of the issues I had with Dagger was that injecting each class was a bit clunky, but as it turned out given that I needed to work with ActionBar activity and at the time RoboGuice <a href="https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice/issues/134">did not support using the compatibility libraries</a> so I needed to write the clunky code to inject the activities anyway.</p>
<p>I noticed that Google had forked the original Square implementation of dagger and appeared to be doing a lot of work on it. I liked the purely generated approach both for speed and debugging so I decided to switch. For <a href="/blog/2014/05/01/ioc-in-native-android-apps.html">comparison with the other two dependency injection mechanisms</a> the fragment or activity class looks like this</p>
<pre>public class RecommendationListFragment extends BaseFragment {
 @Inject
 ILoggerFactory logger;

 protected ApplicationComponent getApplicationComponent(Activity activity) {
  return ((AndroidApplication) activity.getApplication())
    .getApplicationComponent();
 }

 protected boolean isInjected() {
  return logger != null;
 }

 @Override
 public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  getApplicationComponent(getActivity()).inject(this);
 }

 @Override
 public void onResume() {
  super.onResume();
  if (!isInjected()) {
   getApplicationComponent(getActivity()).inject(this);
  }
 }</pre>
<p>I dont remember having to write the onResume code for RoboGuice but it seems like a small detail. The IoC container looked like this</p>
<pre>@Module
public class ApplicationModule {
 private final AndroidApplication application;

 public ApplicationModule(AndroidApplication application) {
  this.application = application;
 }

 @Provides
 @Singleton
 Context provideApplicationContext() {
  return this.application;
 }

 @Provides
 @Singleton
 ILoggerFactory provideLogger(SlfLoggerFactory loggerFactory) {
  return loggerFactory;
 }
}</pre>
<p>The application sets up the container like this</p>
<pre>public class AndroidApplication extends Application {
 private ApplicationComponent applicationComponent;

 final private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AndroidApplication.class);

 @Override
 public void onCreate() {
  logger.warn("Application started");
  super.onCreate();
  this.applicationComponent = initialiseInjector();
  logger.debug("Application IoC bound");
 }

 protected ApplicationComponent initialiseInjector() {
  return DaggerApplicationComponent.builder()
    .applicationModule(new ApplicationModule(this))
    .build();
 }

 public ApplicationComponent getApplicationComponent() {
  return this.applicationComponent;
 }</pre>
<p>Where the DaggerApplicationComponent is generated code.</p>
<p>So far I have been pleased with Dagger2 in the sense that it just works and I&rsquo;ve not had any weird behaviour. I have also started to extend what I do with dependency injection, I have started using scoped containers with presenters and unit tests using a mocked container. I will cover this in another post.</p>
