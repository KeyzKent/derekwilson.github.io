I started my website in the 1990's, I still have some of the [old pages](/derek/pages/newbobs.htm) around. I [started my blog](/blog/2008/10/08/mixing-fire-and-water-aspnet-and-wordpress) around a decade ago. Over the years I have been on a number of platforms.

| Year         | Host                | Technology | Blog |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|:-----|
| 1996         | [GConnect](http://www.gconnect.net)<br> (Local ISP) | Static HTML, ASP (Classic), FrontPage | None |
| 2007         | [WebStrike](http://www.webstrikesolutions.com/easycgi/webstrike/)<br>[EasyCGI](https://www.easycgi.com) | Static HTML, ASP.NET, PHP  | [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) |
| 2012         | [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) | Static HTML, ASP.NET MVC, | [BlogEngine.NET](http://dotnetblogengine.net) |
| 2017         | [Github](https://github.com)<br>[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) | Static HTML, ASP.NET Core | [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)

Moving platform is never straightforward. However the reason for moving each time has been different.

### 2007

This move was motivated by opportunity. There was nothing wrong with my ISP it was simply that they did not offer ASP.NET. I didn't really need ASP.NET but the cost wasn't great and it gave me an opportunity to experiment with my own projects such as [worldolio](https://worldolio.azurewebsites.net). Also I got the chance to run WordPress and start a blog, I wasn't sure that I would actually blog but I though I would give it a go. 

### 2012

This move was motivated by functionality. EasyCGI could or would not upgrade to .NET v4. I was [desperate to move away from WordPress and wanted to move to BlogEngine.NET](/blog/2012/02/22/digital-migration), this required .NET v4 so I moved again.

### 2017

This move was motivated by cost. GoDaddy have been great hosts, the servers are fast, and relatively problem free. There have been a few issues, individually they are not much but together they have become annoying.

1. It costs. <br>Its around 100 USD a year, its not much but I have no revenue stream for this site so its just a cost
1. Running in medium trust. <br>It is a shared server so everyone runs in medium trust. This means I cannot use SQLite instead I am forced into using [SQLServer CE and pre-compiled NHibernate proxies](/blog/2012/06/22/medium-trust-sqlserver-ce-log4net-and-nhibernate). Again the problem has been solved and it does work but I never liked the solution. 
1. BlogEngine. <br>I never kept BlogEngine up to date so I never got the benefit of new updates. To be honest I have about 10 comments that were not generated by a spam bot and about 10,000 that were so I wasn't really making much use of the dynamic nature of BlogEngine.NET. It also never exactly became mainstream and I was become nervous of getting my data trapped in an obsolete system.

## Brave New World

I decided to move to a combination of Github and Azure. The attractions of each are

### Github Pages for Static pages and Blog

1. Free
1. Data easy to extract and move.<br> Its not dynamic, its generated from markdown which should make it easier to get any data out even if I need to extract it as static HTML.
1. Mainstream<br>Jekyll is already more mainstream than BlogEngine ever was so I am pretty confident I would be able to find a new host if needed.
1. Natural<br>At last no more rubbish web based editors, or using an ageing LiveWriter to upload posts, I can use Visual Studio Code and Git, this is an environment I use every day.
1. Fast<br> Using Github to deliver static HTML is very fast.

### Azure for dynamic content (books catalog and worldolio)

1. Free<br>I am surprised that AWS has no free tier. It didn't when I was looking, and Azure does so it gets the nod.
1. Mainstream<br>Once again loads of documentation on how to get anything working in Azure, from old ASP.NET sites to new .NET Core and Node.js
1. Able to use SQLite<br>Which I always preferred to SQLServerCE
