<p>I have previously written about <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2013/03/23/Windows-Media-Center-in-NZ-using-DVB-S.aspx">how to get Windows Media Center working</a> in New Zealand. Recently my Media Center PC died and I needed to rebuild it. In 2016 this was slightly more tricky than I expected.</p><!--more-->
<p>I know that <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/rip-windows-media-center/">Media Center has been deprecated</a> by Microsoft and that it is <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/instantanswers/0f7ec3cd-4376-4087-a7b5-19068ea27305/windows-media-center-is-not-available">not supported on Windows 10</a> however for live TV there really isn't a real alternative. <a href="https://kodi.tv">XBMC / Kodi</a> keeps getting better and eventually I think I will use it but for the moment I will stick with Media Center, after all its <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">still supported by Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>I had an old laptop with a broken screen that I was going to use as a TV. Looking on the internet is appears as though it is possible to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/get-windows-media-center-running-on-windows-10-with-a-f-1729919907">get Media Center to work on Windows 10</a> however I think I wanted something more stable for a TV. So the first task was to install Windows 7. This was my first surprise it turns out that after a new installation of Windows 7 that Windows Update does not work to bring it up to date. it appears that <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/951960/windows-7-sp1-windows-update-stuck-checking-for-updates">I needed to patch the Windows Update Service</a>&nbsp;and then it applied all the required updates.</p>
<p>Then the next surprise was that the most brilliant <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/epgcollector/">EPG Collector</a> was not able to download the TV listings. It looks as though the MHEG5 listing from the DVB-S are not longer working and I needed to move to the OpenTV provider. So my EPGCollector.ini now looks like this</p>
<pre>[GENERAL]
Timeouts=10,300,5,1,50
Option=DuplicateSameChannels,WmcImport,AutoMapEpg,WmcStarSpecial

[DVBS]
Satellite=0
Dish=11300000,11300000,0,,Legacy
TuningFile=160.0&deg;E Optus D1.xml
ScanningFrequency=12519000,22500,3/4,H,OpenTV
Location=NZL,0</pre>
<p>The next surprise was that the listings for TV One were not working I experimented with excluding the first TV One station from the station list and this seemed to work.</p>

<p>I guess there may be other solutions but this one worked for me.</p>
