<p>Last year I <a href="/blog/2014/05/01/ioc-in-native-android-apps.aspx">produced my first native android application</a>. its called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.measureme">measureme</a> and its done ok on googleplay, over 100 downloads and a review of over 4 stars.</p>  <p>it was developed using <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html">eclipse</a> and <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2014/10/20/running-junit-unit-tests-from-ant.aspx">ant</a>, these were the recommended tools at the time and i used them to build release and debug variants and to run unit tests. towards the end of the year <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">android studio</a> 1.0 was officially released and around the same time android 5.0 was released, this prompted me to migrate to the new development toolset of androidstudio and gradle.</p>  <p>when i fired up androidstudio it would import my eclipse project and that did get me 80% of the way to being migrated but as always the remaining 20% needed some fiddling.</p>  <h2>build variants</h2>  <p>it took some time to work out how to make the application work slightly differently when build for release and debug builds using <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2014/08/04/build-configurations-in-native-android-apps-using-ant.html">custom Ant tasks</a>. In android studio the same effect is much easier, in the Gradle script for the app I set the sourceSets like this</p>  <pre>sourceSets {
 debug.setRoot('build-types/debug')
 release.setRoot('build-types/release')
}</pre>

<p>Then I created this folder structure</p>

<p>&#160;<a href="/images/build%20types.png"><img title="build types" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="build types" src="/images/build%20types_thumb.png" width="200" height="292" /></a> </p>

<p>In the assets folder I created a logback.xml config file, one for the debug build and one for the release build and simelally in the java/net/derekwilson/measureme I created a class like this</p>

<pre>package net.derekwilson.measureme;

public class MeasureMeBuildConfig {
 /* Whether or not to include logging statements in the application. */
 public final static boolean PRODUCTION = false;
}</pre>

<p>In AndroidStudio the files in the project treeview are changed depending upon the build variant selected, debug in this case</p>

<p><a href="/images/build%20types2.png"><img title="build types2" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="build types2" src="/images/build%20types2_thumb.png" width="202" height="288" /></a> </p>

<h2>Unit Tests</h2>

<p>Getting the unit tests to run was a bit more fiddly and I am indebted to this post on <a href="http://blog.blundell-apps.com/android-gradle-app-with-robolectric-junit-tests/">getting the unit tests running from the command line</a> and this post on getting them <a href="http://blog.blundell-apps.com/how-to-run-robolectric-junit-tests-in-android-studio/">running from AndroidStudio</a>. After that it was pretty easy to run them from either the command line or AndroidStudio and there is none of the refresh problems that affected Eclipse.</p>

<h2>Signing the App</h2>

<p>Signing and copying the app had been complex and once again I had used a combination of Ant and shell scripts. It was just as complex using Gradle. This is because I needed to enter a password to sign the release apk but I did not want to put the password into the Gradle script as this is an open source project.</p>

<p>It turns out that I can use the Console when I build from the command line but I needed a <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/zrdsmq/signing-configs-with-gradle-android">slightly different mechanism from within AndroidStudio</a>. I made some slight modifications and ended up with this Gradle script.</p>

<pre>import groovy.swing.SwingBuilder
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
 compileSdkVersion 21
 buildToolsVersion &quot;21.1.2&quot;

 defaultConfig {
  applicationId &quot;net.derekwilson.measureme&quot;
  minSdkVersion 7
  targetSdkVersion 21
 }

 signingConfigs {
  release {
   storeFile file(&quot;../../AndroidSupport/deploy/derek.keystore&quot;)
   storePassword &quot;not real password&quot;
   keyAlias &quot;measureme&quot;
   keyPassword &quot;not real password&quot;
  }
 }

 gradle.taskGraph.whenReady { taskGraph -&gt;
  if (taskGraph.hasTask(':app:assembleRelease')) {
   def password = &quot;&quot;

   if (System.console() == null) {
    new SwingBuilder().edt {
     dialog(modal: true,
     title: &quot;Enter signing password&quot;,
     alwaysOnTop: true,
     resizable: false,
     locationRelativeTo: null,
     pack: true,
     show: true
     )
    {
     vbox {
      label(text: &quot;Enter signing password: &quot;)
      input = passwordField()
      button(defaultButton: true,
        text: 'OK',
        actionPerformed: {
          password = new String(input.password)
          dispose();
        })
      }
     }
    }
   } else {
    password = System.console().readPassword(&quot;\nEnter password: &quot;)
    password = new String(password)
   }

   if (password.size() &lt;= 0) {
    throw new InvalidUserDataException(&quot;Empty password&quot;)
   }

   // set signing config key passwords
   android.signingConfigs.release.storePassword = password
   android.signingConfigs.release.keyPassword = password
  }
 }</pre>

<p>The migration did not take that long and I have found AndroidStudio to be great improvement over Eclipse.</p>
