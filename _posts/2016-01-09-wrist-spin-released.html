<p>I bought myself a <a href="https://www.pebble.com/pebble-time-smartwatch-features">Pebble Time</a> smartwatch for my Christmas present to me. I have been pretty pleased with the watch, it seems to do everything that I wanted in a smart watch, its strong points are a 5 day battery life and how readable it is outside.</p><!--more-->  <p>One of the things missing (from my point of view) was real-time cricket score updates. Well over the Christmas break I decided to fix that. I wrote a small app that gets the current live cricket scores from a <a href="http://cricscore-api.appspot.com">web service</a>. </p>  <p><a href="/images/promo1.png"><img title="promo1" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="promo1" src="/images/promo1_thumb.png" width="347" height="157" /></a></p>  <p>You can get <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/56904b60e74aedc6b600000b?dev_settings=true&amp;query=wrist-spin&amp;section=watchapps">wrist-spin</a> from the Pebble store. Even if nobody else uses the app when my watch does a little vibrate because a wicket has fallen while I am doing something else it makes me smile.</p>
