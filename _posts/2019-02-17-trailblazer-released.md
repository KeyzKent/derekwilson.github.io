Very pleased to be finally releasing [Trailblazer][trailblazer-play]. Its taken quite a while to get it released but the first version is now ready.

Trailblazer is a simple, quick and easy to use track recorder, for hiking, running cycling etc. You can record and share your tracks. The app was inspired by MyTracks - a Google app that is now deprecated. The app is supported on all Android phones from Android 4 up.
