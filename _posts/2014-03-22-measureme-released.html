<p>In the past I have produced HTML5 Phonegap application, <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2013/09/26/TextByNumbers-available-on-Google-Play.aspx">TextByNumbers</a>, for android. Last month I spent some time working on a native android application I was interested to see what challenges it would present and how it would differ from an HTML5 application.</p><!--more-->  <p>I needed to get through the development lifecycle quickly, from start to the play store was only four weeks. I think that its resulted in a useful tool as well as giving me a much better understanding of native android development.</p>  <p>The tool is called MeasureMe, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.measureme">the app is in the play store</a> and the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/measureme">code is on bitbucket</a>. Its a low friction personal measurement tool. The measurements it currently supports are focussed on pain, sleep or energy diaries.</p>  <p>The workflow is that the user creates as many alarms as they need and hook them up to measurement scales, when the alarm goes off its just a simple swipe to record the measurement. The measurement is recorded in a csv text file and can be easily emailed for analysis in a spreadsheet.</p>
