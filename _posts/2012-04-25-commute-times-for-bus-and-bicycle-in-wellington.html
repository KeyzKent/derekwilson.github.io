<p>A while ago <a href="/blog/2011/01/30/commute-times-for-car-tram-and-bicycle-in-manchester.html">I compared commute times in Manchester</a>, I now live in Wellington and thought it would be interesting to repeat the exercise (no pun intended) here.</p>
<p>I live a little further out of town in Wellington, the routes I use its about 12.5 KM to work and 11.5 KM home. When I use the bus I have to walk about 5 minutes to the bus stop from my house, the bus stop is right outside work. I usually leave between 7:30 am and 8 am in the morning, which is rush hour, in the evening its usually after 5:30 so a little after peek travel time for most people.</p>
<p>Unlike Manchester, which was relatively flat, the trip times in Wellington is skewed as we live at the top of a hill, The elevation gain in meters on the way home looks like this</p>

<p>Once again I collected at least 10 tracks in each direction for each mode of transport, using the wonderful <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/mytracks/">My Tracks</a>. The results are</p>

<p>The cycle trips do not include time to get changed, but generally reflect what I felt was happening, it was fasted in the morning to cycle and faster to use the bus in the evening.</p>
<p>Once again I plotted the spread of times, I appear to have got quicker at going to work as I got used to riding here.</p>

<p>In Manchester it was obvious that it was faster to commute using a cycle, in Wellington the advantage is less apparent. However if you take into account the steepness of the hill (trust me its as steep as it looks) then I guess I am surprised that I am able to keep up with the bus on the way home.</p>
<p>Having just done my medical for my visa I can attest that I am getting fitter</p>
