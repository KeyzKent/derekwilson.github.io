<p>When I am writing tests I find it useful to have a coverage tool. Since <a href="http://www.ncover.com/blog/2007/09/17/uncovering-the-new-ncover/">NCover is no longer free</a> I have started to use <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/opencover/downloads">OpenCover</a> I like OpenCover, it is a mature product that works well and as a free open source project its great for my personal projects. I also use the excellent <a href="http://reportgenerator.codeplex.com/">ReportGenerator</a> to format the output from OpenCover.</p>  <p>I recently needed to use a coverage tool to work with some <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/">xUnit</a> tests and I knocked together some scripts but it turned out to be a bit more complex than I thought.</p>  <p>For this example I used an example app “MyApp” which contained a class called ObjectUnderTest and I wrote some tests in MyApp.Tests. I’ve installed OpenCover to its default location in C:\Users\derek.wilson\AppData\Local\Apps\OpenCover and ReportGenerator does not really install so I have just copied it into a folder called ReportGenerator in the same location as OpenCover. xUnit is also installed in its default location.</p>  <p>The command script to run the tests that I first put together looked like this</p>  <pre class="csharp">C:\Users\derek.wilson\AppData\Local\Apps\OpenCover\opencover.console -output:coverage.xml -target:&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\xUnit\xunit.console.clr4.exe&quot; -targetargs:&quot;MyApp.Tests\bin\Debug\MyApp.Tests.dll&quot; -filter:&quot;+[*]MyApp.* -[*.Tests]*&quot;
C:\Users\derek.wilson\AppData\Local\Apps\ReportGenerator\bin\reportgenerator coverage.xml .\coverage
start .\coverage\index.htm</pre>

<p>The mechanism here is that I get “opencover.console” to use “xunit.console.clr4.exe” to run the tests in the MyApp.Tests.dll, however all we see is this</p>

<pre class="csharp">xUnit.net console test runner (64-bit .NET 4.0.30319.269)
Copyright (C) 2007-11 Microsoft Corporation.

xunit.dll:     Version 1.8.0.1549

No results - no assemblies that matched the supplied filter were instrumented (missing PDBs?)</pre>

<p>In the documentation for OpenCover it does recommend that the profiler be registered so I registered the 64bit version as I was running on a 64 bit OS.</p>

<pre class="csharp">regsvr32 C:\Users\derek.wilson\AppData\Local\Apps\OpenCover\x64\OpenCover.Profiler.dll</pre>

<p>However it still did not work. It turns out that I needed to specify the xUnit noshadow switch, I did this in an xunit project file as I was going to need one anyway as soon as I had more than a few DLLs, like this</p>

<pre class="csharp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xunit&gt;
  &lt;assemblies&gt;
    &lt;assembly filename=&quot;MyApp.Tests\bin\Debug\MyApp.Tests.dll&quot; shadow-copy=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/assemblies&gt;
&lt;/xunit&gt;</pre>

<p>I then changed the script to use the xunit project file like this</p>

<pre class="csharp">C:\Users\derek.wilson\AppData\Local\Apps\OpenCover\opencover.console -output:coverage.xml -target:&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\xUnit\xunit.console.clr4.exe&quot; -targetargs:&quot;MyApp.xunit&quot; -filter:&quot;+[*]MyApp.* -[*.Tests]*&quot;
C:\Users\derek.wilson\AppData\Local\Apps\ReportGenerator\bin\reportgenerator coverage.xml .\coverage
start .\coverage\index.htm</pre>

<p>And it started to work – like this</p>
