<p>I have done a little bit of tidying up in MeasureMe and published a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.measureme">new version to the play store</a>.</p><!--more-->  <p><a href="/images/promo11.png"><img title="promo11" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="promo11" src="/images/promo11_thumb.png" width="179" height="295" /></a> </p>  <p>I have made manual measurements easier to trigger, by using the icon next to the measure on the main screen. This enables a measurement to be taken immediately. I have also added new scales for anxiety and depression as well as adding a spreadsheet to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B23to89C5IkuNkotMXJzQXJlUDQ&amp;usp=sharing">example spreadsheet folder</a>.</p>  <p><a href="/images/promotablet4.png"><img title="promotablet4" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="promotablet4" src="/images/promotablet4_thumb.png" width="183" height="290" /></a></p>
