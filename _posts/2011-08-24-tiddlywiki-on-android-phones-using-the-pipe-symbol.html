<p>Solving this problem made me laugh, and cry. It did remind me of something I heard years ago</p>

<p>I like using <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">tiddlywiki</a>, I&rsquo;ve used it as a super todo.txt for a long time. I stumbled on an <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/andtidwiki-beta/de.mgsimon.android.andtidwiki">implementation for Android</a> which in turn was based on <a href="http://itw.bidix.info/">iTW</a> for the iPhone. The iTW tiddlywiki has been tweaked to only display one tiddler at once and the render and toolbar has been optimised for a small screen.</p>
<p>I got it and downloaded it and all was well it worked straight out of the box on my HTC Wildfire. I just wanted to put a few notes into it to get started, this worked fine and then I tried to edit a table, ahhhh problem.</p>
<p>Like a lot of Wiki markup languages <a href="http://tiddlywiki.org/bags/tiddlywiki_public/tiddlers/TiddlyWiki%20Markup.html">tables are constructed out of the pipe symbol</a> and then I found a problem &ndash; the stock HTC keyboard <a href="http://www.geekzone.co.nz/forums.asp?forumid=97&amp;topicid=70626">does not have a pipe symbol</a>, you can get alternate keyboards but these seem to involve &ldquo;rooting&rdquo; the device &ndash; it seemed a bit of overkill to me. If I went to the symbol page of the keyboard input and pressed the 1/2 button to go the the second page of symbols there is a &brvbar; symbol which is not the same as a pipe |. Annoyingly there are even blank unused keys on the second page of symbols.</p>
<p>Anyway it did give me an opportunity to have a go at starting to modify the TiddlyWiki. This is what I did, I found the section of code in the TiddlyWiki HTML file that was responsible for formatting a table, in a blank AndTidWiki file its at line 3185 but looking for &ldquo;table&rdquo; soon finds it &ndash; it looks like this</p>
<pre class="c#">//--
//-- Standard formatters
//--

config.formatters = [
{
 name: "table",
 match: "^\\|(?:[^\\n]*)\\|(?:[fhck]?)$",
 lookaheadRegExp: /^\|([^\n]*)\|([fhck]?)$/mg,
 rowTermRegExp: /(\|(?:[fhck]?)$\n?)/mg,
 cellRegExp: /(?:\|([^\n\|]*)\|)|(\|[fhck]?$\n?)/mg,
 cellTermRegExp: /((?:\x20*)\|)/mg,
 rowTypes: {"c":"caption", "h":"thead", "":"tbody", "f":"tfoot"},
 handler: function(w)
 {
  var table = createTiddlyElement(w.output,"table",null,"twtable");</pre>
<p>And I replaced it with this, which just modifies the regular expressions to accept either a pipe or the double vertical bar</p>
<pre class="c#"> match: "^[\\|&brvbar;](?:[^\\n]*)[\\|&brvbar;](?:[fhck]?)$",
 lookaheadRegExp: /^[\|&brvbar;]([^\n]*)[\|&brvbar;]([fhck]?)$/mg,
 rowTermRegExp: /([\|&brvbar;](?:[fhck]?)$\n?)/mg,
 cellRegExp: /(?:[\|&brvbar;]([^\n\|&brvbar;]*)[\|&brvbar;])|([\|&brvbar;][fhck]?$\n?)/mg,
 cellTermRegExp: /((?:\x20*)[\|&brvbar;])/mg,</pre>
<p>Basically its a very simple edit &ndash; I just made the pipe and the HTC double vertical bar work interchangeable and I could use either &ndash; pipe is easier on a PC keyboard and the &brvbar; the only option at the moment on the phone.</p>
