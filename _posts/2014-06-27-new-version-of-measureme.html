<p>I have done a small update to MeasureMe. I found a bug where some of the values in the Units Consumed were missing. The fix is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.measureme">in the play store now</a>. Iâ€™ve also added another <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B23to89C5IkuNkotMXJzQXJlUDQ&amp;usp=sharing">example spreadsheet</a> for Units Consumed.</p>
