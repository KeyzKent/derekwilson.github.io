This month we have released a new version of [Trailblazer][trailblazer-play].

Trailblazer is a simple, quick and easy to use track recorder, for hiking, running cycling etc. You can record and share your tracks. The app was inspired by MyTracks - a Google app that is now deprecated. The app is supported on all Android phones from Android 4 up.

The new version can now real and write [KML format files][kml-format], which means that it can access files that were saved from the old Google MyTracks app.

The [source code][trailblazer-source] is in bitbucket.
