Over the years I have produced a large number of "Hello World"s. In many ways this is the most complex and in other ways it is one of the more straightforward.

The world in this instance is likely to be a very small world. I really just need an online CMS system to keep some pages that are easy to update and information that I tend to forget if I do not write it down.

I guess the audience of this blog is, at least initially, me.
