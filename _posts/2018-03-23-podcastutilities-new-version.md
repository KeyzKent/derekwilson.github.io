This month I have done a maintenance release of PodcastUtilities. I have noticed that the playlists generated by PodcastUtilities do not work on an Android device. I dont really use them on Android and they worked fine on Windows so it wasnt a big deal but it did irritate me.

I had a look at the file specification for [ASX][asx-url] and [WPL][wpl-url] and I was suprised to see that although the format of the files were specified the format of any local file references was not. I guessed that the issue was the path separator, PodcastUtilities used the windows style `\` if I changed it to the Unix standard `/` then it worked fine on Android and still worked on Windows. 

So I added to the configuration of playlists like this

```
<playlistFilename>podcasts.m3u</playlistFilename>
<playlistFormat>m3u</playlistFormat>
<playlistPathSeparator>/</playlistPathSeparator>
```

While I was doing this I also added support for [M3U][m3u-url] format playlists as they are very commonly supported by players.

The new version (2.2.0.0) is now in [GitHub][code-url] and also available as a [binary download][download-url] if you just want to run PodcastUtilities.
