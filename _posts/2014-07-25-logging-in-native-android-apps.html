<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.derekwilson.measureme">MeasureMe</a> was my first native Android application. <a href="/blog/2014/05/01/ioc-in-native-android-apps.aspx">previously</a> iâ€™ve commented on the basic framework needed to start developing an app and one of the most basic elements is logging.</p>  <p>in my previous projects in .net i have used emterprise library and log4net and they have both been fine. obviously for an android application i was going to need a java based framework. i have already blogged about how i <a href="http://derekwilson.net/derekblog/post/2012/06/22/medium-trust-sqlserver-ce-log4net-and-nhibernate.html">migrated from one logging Enterprise Library to Log4Net</a>. It was relatively easy as I had implement a facade layer so logging framework specific references were in the main body of the code.</p>  <p>When I looked around for an equivalent in Java I found that <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">slf4j</a> is a purpose built logging facade and for Android <a href="http://tony19.github.io/logback-android/">Logback</a> appeared to be a popular choice. slf4j acts as a barrier meaning that I can swap real real logging implementations behind it.</p>  <p>To get the whole thing off the ground all I needed to do was download slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar and logback-android-1.0.10-2.jar and place them in the libs folder.</p>  <p>Then to perform any logging in a class I just reference an ILoggerFactory like this</p>  <pre>public class OpenSourceLicensesActivity extends RoboActivity {

 @Inject
 private ILoggerFactory logger;

 @Override
 protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_open_source_licenses);

  logger.getCurrentApplicationLogger().debug(&quot;OSLicensesActivity.onCreate()&quot;);</pre>

<p>The ILoggerFactory dependency is injected by Guice as I covered in an earlier post. The implementation of ILoggerFactory for slf4j looks like this</p>

<pre>public class SlfLoggerFactory implements ILoggerFactory {
  @Override
  public Logger getCurrentApplicationLogger() {
    return LoggerFactory.getLogger(MeasureMe.class);
  }
}</pre>

<p>The actual logging is done by Logback. Logback takes its configuration from an XML file in the assets folder.</p>

<pre><configuration debug="true">&lt;property name=&quot;LOG_HOME&quot; value=&quot;/sdcard/MeasureMe&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;!-- Create a logcat appender --&gt;
  &lt;appender name=&quot;logcat&quot; class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.classic.android.LogcatAppender&quot;&gt;
    &lt;encoder&gt;
      &lt;pattern&gt;%msg&lt;/pattern&gt;
    &lt;/encoder&gt;
  &lt;/appender&gt;

  &lt;appender name=&quot;FILE&quot; class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender&quot;&gt;
    &lt;file&gt;${LOG_HOME}/mm_main.log&lt;/file&gt;
    &lt;rollingPolicy class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.FixedWindowRollingPolicy&quot;&gt;
      &lt;fileNamePattern&gt;${LOG_HOME}/mm_main.%i.log&lt;/fileNamePattern&gt;
      &lt;minIndex&gt;1&lt;/minIndex&gt;
      &lt;maxIndex&gt;2&lt;/maxIndex&gt;
    &lt;/rollingPolicy&gt;

    &lt;triggeringPolicy class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy&quot;&gt;
      &lt;maxFileSize&gt;500KB&lt;/maxFileSize&gt;
    &lt;/triggeringPolicy&gt;
    &lt;encoder&gt;
      &lt;pattern&gt;%date{yyyy-MMM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %t %r %logger{15} - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
    &lt;/encoder&gt;
  &lt;/appender&gt;

  &lt;logger 
    name=&quot;main&quot; 
    level=&quot;WARN&quot; 
  &gt;
    &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;logcat&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;FILE&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/logger&gt;

  &lt;root level=&quot;WARN&quot;&gt;
    &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;logcat&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;FILE&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/root&gt;
  
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>

<p>A point to note here is configuring the path to the logfile, this is set in the property LOG_HOME to be /sdcard/MeasureMe. Not all Android devices have sdcard slots, though even the ones that do not appear to mount emulated sdcards using the name sdcard. However I could find the path programmatically but the only way to do this from code was to break the facade and reach into the logback implementation and set the path, I was keen to keep the code clean so I am still looking for a configuration based solution.</p>

<p>Another interesting part is to configure release and debug builds to have different logging levels I will cover the mechanism in a different post.</p>

<p>The only place in the code where I did not use this pattern is in the main application.</p>

<pre>public class MeasureMe extends Application {
	
 // Deliberately not using IoC for this - as this class is where IoC is setup
 final private Logger _logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MeasureMe.class);

 @Override
 public void onCreate() {
  _logger.warn(&quot;Application started v{}, debug {}, production build {}&quot;,
    getVersionName(getApplicationContext()),
    BuildConfig.DEBUG,
    MeasureMeBuildConfig.PRODUCTION);

  super.onCreate();
  RoboGuice.setBaseApplicationInjector(
    this,
    RoboGuice.DEFAULT_STAGE,
    RoboGuice.newDefaultRoboModule(this),
    new IoCModule());

  _logger.debug(&quot;Application IoC bound&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>I wanted to be able to log if I had a bug in the IoC container logic and for that reason the code in the main application gets its own logger in case IoC is broken.&#160; </p>
