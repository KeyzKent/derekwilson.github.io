<p>I listen to lots of podcasts, both technical and for entertainment. The problem I have had for a long time is that I need software that will download episodes from a specified list of podcasts and, as I keep a large number of podcasts on my computer then synchronise a subset to a mobile device. Although there are options all seemed unsatisfactory somehow I object to running the large memory foot print of a program like iTunes when I really only need to download once a week. Also I wanted to be able to control which episodes were synchronised, 3 of this podcast, all of another, and none of the software I tried seemed to be able to support that level of configuration.</p>
<p>So the obvious solution, to me, was to write something that would do the job. It also give me an opportunity to collaborate with <a href="http://www.lightbulbsoftware.com/andrew/blog/">Andrew</a> on software which is fun, and I learn things and it gets written faster. It also gave us an opportunity to use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Mercurial as hosted by Bitbucket</a> while collaborating. We were both keen to explore working on a open source project.</p>
<p>Around Christmas we started working on utilities to handle synchronisation. This month we have opened to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/podcastutilities/wiki/Home">PodcastUtilities project</a> to everyone. PodcastUtilities are utilities that will provide portable, configurable,&nbsp; lightweight, scriptable utilities to download and synchronise podcasts. The initial codebase handles synchronisation.</p>
