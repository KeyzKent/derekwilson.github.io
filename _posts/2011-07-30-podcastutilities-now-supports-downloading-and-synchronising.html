<p>A couple of months ago <a href="/2011/05/20/podcastutilities.html">I mentioned</a> PodcastUtilities. This month we have produced a new version of PodcastUtilities that now supports downloading and synchronising podcast media files. You can download a compiled version of PodcastUtilities in a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/podcastutilities/downloads">zip file from BitBucket</a></p>

<p>For the last five years I have been using <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/">Juice</a> and it has provided sterling service as a podcast downloader, however it appears to have been dormant for the last six years since the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/11/14/apple-legal-forces-ipodder-name-change/">run in with Apple</a>. Sometimes Juice gets confused and downloads podcasts that it has already downloaded. Also, I download to a flash drive which means that I can use my main computer or my netbook to keep up to date with my podcasts, I use a <a href="http://portableapps.com/node/12082">portable version of Juice</a> from the utterly wonderful folk over at portable apps, however it does not seem to play well with Windows 7 and can sometimes get confused about where to store its downloads.</p>
<p>PodcastUtilities has now reached the stage where I can stop using Juice and move over to using my own app. If anyone else would like a downloader then <a href="https://bitbucket.org/derekwilson/podcastutilities/overview">head over to BitBucket</a> and give it a whirl.</p>
<h3>The main advantages of <span>PodcastUtilities</span></h3>
<p>&middot; Portable <br />Podcast Utilities is a &ldquo;portable&rdquo; application, in that it does not need to be installed and can be run from any drive type, local network or removable flash drive</p>
<p>&middot; Configurable <br />Almost any synchronisation solution can be configured, for example copy 3 of this podcast, all of these podcasts, in this order, and leave a certain amount of space on the device. The number of concurrent downloads can easily be configured.</p>
<p>&middot; Lightweight <br />The application does not use large amounts of memory in a system tray icon all the time its not being used, it only uses system resources when its being run.</p>
<p>&middot; Scriptable <br />Podcast Utilities lends itself to being run as a scheduled task or from a script. The API is &ldquo;headless&rdquo; and can easily be called and used from other applications</p>
<p>&middot; Open Source <br />The source is open and available</p>
<p>&middot; Free <br />There is no cost to using Podcast Utilities for any use.</p>
<p>&middot; No need for an iTunes account <br />Podcasts promoted on iTunes can be downloaded however there is no need to have an iTunes account.</p>
