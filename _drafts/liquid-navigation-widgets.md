Now my blog is hosted on [Github Pages][github-pages-url] using [Jekyll][jekyll-url] I found that I need to make some additions to the default template. I used the default template as it has a pretty well structured set of includes meaning that I can add my own widgets pretty easily.

The last main piece that I wanted to add from my previous blog was navigation controls. I wanted a timeline of blog posts as well as navigation by categories.
